# Google Service Account Setup Guide

## Overview

The Property Insights Tool now uses Google Service Account authentication for Google Sheets integration. This is more secure and reliable than API keys, especially for production environments.

## üîê Service Account Details

- **Service Account Email**: `lh-n8n-service@my-project-db-389005.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Project ID**: `my-project-db-389005`
- **Key ID**: `c5d7aaff84fb15c6df322dbb430228481418ec71`

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Get the Private Key

You'll need to obtain the private key for the service account:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=my-project-db-389005
2. **Find the service account**: `lh-n8n-service@my-project-db-389005.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. **Click "Actions"** ‚Üí **"Manage keys"**
4. **Create a new key** (if needed): Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create new key" ‚Üí "JSON"
5. **Copy the private key** from the downloaded JSON file (the `private_key` field)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Google Service Account Configuration
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=lh-n8n-service@my-project-db-389005.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID=c5d7aaff84fb15c6df322dbb430228481418ec71
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=my-project-db-389005
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` with the actual private key
- Keep the quotes around the private key
- Ensure newlines are escaped as `\n`

### 3. Share Spreadsheet with Service Account

1. **Open the spreadsheet**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XVAxEPF6ZfD2zlqPB0kvSyQOP41z8iF6GD9vrG4qHg
2. **Click "Share"**
3. **Add the service account email**: `lh-n8n-service@my-project-db-389005.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. **Set permission to "Viewer"**
5. **Click "Send"**

### 4. Test the Setup

Run the setup helper script:

```bash
# Set environment variables and run the test
npm run test:service-account

# Or test using the API endpoint
npm run dev
# Then visit: http://localhost:3000/api/sheets?action=test
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Vercel Deployment

For production deployment on Vercel:

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"**
3. **Add the following variables**:
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` = `lh-n8n-service@my-project-db-389005.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID` = `c5d7aaff84fb15c6df322dbb430228481418ec71`
   - `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` = `my-project-db-389005`
4. **Redeploy your application**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check that the private key is correctly formatted
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set
   - Verify the service account exists in the project

2. **"Access denied to spreadsheet"**
   - Make sure the spreadsheet is shared with the service account
   - Verify the service account has at least "Viewer" permission
   - Check that the spreadsheet ID is correct

3. **"Private key format error"**
   - Ensure the private key includes `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
   - Make sure newlines are escaped as `\n` in the environment variable
   - Don't include extra spaces or characters

### Test Commands:

```bash
# Test service account setup
node scripts/setup-service-account.js

# Test API endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/sheets?action=test"

# Check environment variables
echo $GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

## üéØ Benefits of Service Account Authentication

- **Security**: No API keys to manage or expose
- **Reliability**: More stable authentication for server-to-server communication
- **Granular Control**: Specific permissions for the service account
- **Production Ready**: Designed for production environments
- **Vercel Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Vercel's environment variable system

## üìã Migration from API Key

If you were previously using an API key, the service account method is now the recommended approach. The old API key method is still supported as a fallback, but service account authentication is more secure and reliable.

To migrate:
1. Set up the service account environment variables (above)
2. Remove or comment out `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY` from your environment
3. Test the service account authentication
4. Deploy with the new environment variables

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once configured, your Google Sheets integration will:
- ‚úÖ Fetch data from Room 1-14 sheets
- ‚úÖ Display sync indicators on room cards
- ‚úÖ Show additional details in room modals
- ‚úÖ Provide real-time data refresh capabilities
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully with detailed diagnostics
